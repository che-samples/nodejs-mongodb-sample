# MongoDB
The application connects to the Mongo data base, so it should be configured with next parameters:

# Deploy the application on Kubernetes cluster by kubectl command-line tool
- Before you begin you need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the `kubectl` command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster. If you do not already have a cluster
- Deploy MongoDB:
